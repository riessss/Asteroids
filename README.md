# Asteroids
This is an Asteroids game developed with pygame. You have 3 lives and can shoot the astroids to gain points.
The game is playable but still in development. My goal is to make it an .exe executable game for others (non developers) to play. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start
#### 1. Clone repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/riessss/Asteroids.git 
cd Asteroids
```
#### 2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```
#### 3. Run the game
```bash
uv run main.py
```
## Install uv
```bash
# Install uv
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or via pipx
pipx install uv
# or via pip (less common)
pip install uv
```
